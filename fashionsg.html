        <h1> Fashion Industry in Singapore </h1>
        <p>
            The fashion industry is one of the major polluting industries. It is known to be responsible for about 10% of the greenhouse gas
            emission worldwide (more carbon emissions than the aviation and shipping industries combined), but it is also under fire for
            polluting the ocean with microplastics. About 60% of clothing materials are made of plastics, including polyester, acrylic and
            nylon textiles. According to Tecnon Orbichem, a chemical data company, they predicted that the production of polyester would
            triple in amount per annum between 2007 and 2025.
            With a soaring demand, the amount of clothes disposed of increases significantly and negatively impacts the environment, where
            85% of all these textiles will eventually end up in landfills every year. Research shows only 6% of textile wastes are recycled.
            This is especially worrying as the starting petroleum materials for synthetic polyesters is also a growingly finite resource.
            Singapore’s small land area further spells out the urgency for a solution.
            Therefore, apparel companies are now expected and pressured into bearing the responsibility of lowering the environmental risks
            of such commercialised production processes. Singapore, acclimated to being the greenest city in Asia and the fourth greenest
            city of the world, does not readily offer a sustainable alternative for apparel yet.

            Currently, millennial generations with purchasing power have high expectations and greatly favour businesses that operate
            sustainably. Singapore needs refreshment, starting with broadening the options available in the prevalent market that is apparels.

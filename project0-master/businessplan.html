                            Currently in the Singapore apparel market, there is a lack of eco-friendly textiles able to
                            integrate into
                            current

                            There are currently no direct competitors of eco-friendly textiles in the apparel industry
                            in Singapore.
                            This may be due to the many challenges faced by green suppliers and manufacturers. Most
                            green suppliers and
                            manufacturers struggle to keep up with environmental commitment especially when there is
                            high investment
                            and low return involved in green initiatives. This could be the biggest deterrence faced by
                            our
                            predecessors. Green business may not be economically beneficial in the short-term.
                            Therefore, only
                            organisations with stronger financial capabilities are able to rise up and reap long term
                            benefits from the
                            collaboration.
                            Here are common crucial barriers of entry for green textiles in Singapore
                            <ul>
                                <li>Absence of reward system</li>
                                <li>Lack of new technology, materials and processes</li>
                                <li>Lack of economic benefits</li>
                                <li>Reluctance of support by supply chain partners</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>Our competitors generally offer lower priced textiles and the manufacturing processes
                                are situated in
                                lower-wage countries
                                compared to Singapore such as Malaysia, Indonesia and China. However, they bring about
                                substantial
                                pollution with the
                                current source of textiles derived from cotton and polyester. Importantly, financial
                                incentives can be
                                a
                                good reward

                                green management.
                                The end consumers are typically willing to pay a little more for green products and
                                services.

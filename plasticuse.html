            <h2> Business Strategy </h2>
            <p>
                Lil Green Wear will establish business locally through different stages. Focusing on a B2B model, catering to
                industrial partners such as uniform manufacturers by offering PEF textiles and other environmentally friendly textiles produced
                from our R&D efforts.

            <h2>Unique Selling Proposition</h2>
            <p>
                Our company selected Polyethylene Furanoate (PEF) due to its superior barrier, mechanical and thermal properties.
                Currently in the Singapore apparel market, there is a lack of eco-friendly textiles able to integrate into current
                PET recycling streams and meeting cost expectations without negative impacts. We pride ourselves in providing superior
                quality eco-friendly textiles at affordable prices with maximal benefits for everyone. Conversion of industrial wastes
                into valued products within a closed lifecycle loop.

            <h2>Competitor Analysis</h2>
            <p>
                There are currently no direct competitors of eco-friendly textiles in the apparel industry in Singapore. This may be due to the many challenges faced by green suppliers and manufacturers. Most green suppliers and manufacturers struggle to keep up with environmental commitment especially when there is high investment and low return involved in green initiatives. This could be the biggest deterrence faced by our predecessors. Green business may not be economically beneficial in the short-term. Therefore, only organisations with stronger financial capabilities are able to rise up and reap long term benefits from the collaboration.
                Here are common crucial barriers of entry for green textiles in Singapore
                <ul>
                    <li>Absence of reward system</li>
                    <li>Lack of new technology, materials and processes</li>
                    <li>Lack of economic benefits</li>
                    <li>Reluctance of support by supply chain partners</li>
                </ul>
                Our competitors generally offer lower priced textiles and the manufacturing processes are situated in lower-wage countries
                compared to Singapore such as Malaysia, Indonesia and China. However, they bring about substantial pollution with the
                current source of textiles derived from cotton and polyester. Importantly, financial incentives can be a good reward
                system from the government body to encourage suppliers in taking initiatives towards green management.
                The end consumers are typically willing to pay a little more for green products and services.
            </p>


            <h2>Competitive Advantages</h2>
            Our company will position our products on a ‘More for More’ basis. We will provide superior quality textiles from a
            technology, using current horticulture wastes in Singapore. Concurrently, we will work towards being self-sufficient by
            performing continuous R&D on other eco-friendly materials. By converting wastes into valuable products, Lil Green Wear will
            be able to manufacture in the long run, in terms of supply and demand as millennial generations with purchasing power will have
            high expectations that greatly favours businesses operating sustainably. There are many massive apparel brands such as H&M,
            Gap, ASOS and Arcadia who have signed up to “Fashion Love by Forest”, a non-profit environmental group which commits companies
            to using fabrics without deforestation. These major players in apparel and footwear serve as good partners to collaborate
            with for PEF materials to infiltrate, ideal for each of their environmentally sustainable missions.

            <h2>Critical Success Factors</h2>



            <u>                    Strong Support from the Singapore Government</u>
            <div>
                <p>
                    It is crucial for the Singapore Government to spearhead movements towards environmental friendliness. The required supportive
                    actions are in the form of grants and green legislation to keep our business ecosystem intact. Encouraged selection of PEF
                    textiles with long-term contracts by apparel manufacturers with headquarters based in Singapore will be acquired with this.
                </p>

                <u> Quality Assurance and Cost Effectiveness</u>

                <p>
                    Assurance of quality must be demonstrated to all parties. Supporting evidence from Avantium can be located for relevant use.
                    Prototype production with the licensed technology and evaluation of production processes in our textile factories can be
                    assessed for further supplementation.
                </p>

                <u> Positive Ecosystem Impacts and Recyclability</u>

                <p>
                    Implementation of PEF into local recycling facilities handling PET should be tested. Negative impacts should not be demonstrated
                    in this process. This factor will differentiate us from other textile producers.
                </p>

                <u>Continuous R&D for optimisations or inventions of novel technologies</u>

                <p>
                    Sustaining continuous pursuit of R&D in environmentally friendly materials is crucial for our company to stay ahead in the
                    textile industry. Therefore, innovating textiles with desirable qualities, affordability and recyclability forms an important
                    criteria in the survival and growth of our business.

            <p>
                there are a myriad of eco-friendly textile alternatives out there. Future R&D may be considered if future assessment 
                signals appropriate utilisation in our context. Despite the available options, many of these materials do not fit the 
                requirements for uniforms. They appear to compromise on quality (recycled fiber, peace silk), tap on food sources (PLA, 
                soybean fibre), require high manpower (organic cotton), time-consuming (pineapple fibre), are specialised to specific plant 
                types (hemp, lyocell) or carry potential health concerns (organic wool, rayon).

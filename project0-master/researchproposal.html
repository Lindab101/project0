        <h3 class="h3text"> PEF</h3>
        <p>My research proposal is concerned with the research and development of the production of sustainable fabrics,
        made from PEF. PEF is chosen based on thourough research.
        However, Lil Green Wear wants to extend its R&D into alternative eco-friendly textiles.
        </p>
        <h3 class="h3text">Alternatives</h3>
        <p>
            There are a myriad of eco-friendly textile alternatives out there. Future R&D may be considered if future
            assessment
            signals appropriate utilisation in our context. Despite the available options, many of these materials do
            not fit the
            requirements for apparel. They appear to compromise on quality (recycled fiber, peace silk), tap on food
            sources (PLA,
            soybean fibre), require high manpower (organic cotton), time-consuming (pineapple fibre), are specialised
            to specific plant
            types (hemp, lyocell) or carry potential health concerns (organic wool, rayon).

                    produce methane in landfills which can harm the Earth and humans.

                    to cotton and has a high yield of 20-30% plant made of fibre.

                    cause Parkinsonï¿½s disease and other health problems. Big manufacturers may replace original trees
                    with
                    bamboos for large scale productions, which may not be as friendly to the environment.

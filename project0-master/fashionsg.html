                    The fashion industry is one of the major polluting industries. It is known to be responsible for
                    about 10%
                    of the greenhouse gas
                    emission worldwide (more carbon emissions than the aviation and shipping industries combined), but
                    it is
                    also under fire for
                    polluting the ocean with microplastics. About 60% of clothing materials are made of plastics,
                    including
                    polyester, acrylic and
                    nylon textiles. According to Tecnon Orbichem, a chemical data company, they predicted that the
                    production
                    of polyester would
                    triple in amount per annum between 2007 and 2025.
                    With a soaring demand, the amount of clothes disposed of increases significantly and negatively
                    impacts the
                    environment, where
                    85% of all these textiles will eventually end up in landfills every year. Research shows only 6% of
                    textile
                    wastes are recycled.
                    This is especially worrying as the starting petroleum materials for synthetic polyesters is also a
                    growingly finite resource.
                    Singapore's small land area further spells out the urgency for a solution.
                    Therefore, apparel companies are now expected and pressured into bearing the responsibility of
                    lowering the
                    environmental risks
                    of such commercialised production processes. Singapore, acclimated to being the greenest city in
                    Asia and
                    the fourth greenest
                    city of the world, does not readily offer a sustainable alternative for apparel yet.

                    Currently, millennial generations with purchasing power have high expectations and greatly favour
                    businesses that operate
                    sustainably. Spotting the current trend and with consideration to the local context, Lil Green Wear
                    aims to
                    cater this demand
                    with the development of bioplastics and alternative options to replace the polyester content in
                    apparel. It
                    is the refreshment
                    Singapore needs, starting with broadening the options available in the prevalent market that is
                    apparels.
                    Bioplastics are currently recognised as a key sustainable material in the 21st century by offering
                    balance
                    between environmental
                    benefits and impact of plastics. Polyethylene 2,5-furandicarboxylate (PEF) is a polymer that highly
                    resembles PET, which is one
                    of the commonly used materials to manufacture fibers for clothing.
                    Lil Green Wear aims to research a technology to produce bioplastic PEF. One of the main channels we
                    aim to
                    obtain our raw materials
                    from, comes from food waste, from which only 17% was recycled in 2018. This is in line with
                    Singapore's
                    efforts in achieving
                    the 3Rs, which can help us in securing positive support of customers and financial support of the
                    government with a grant with
                    regards to sustainability.

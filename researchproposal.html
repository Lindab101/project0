            <h2> PEF</h2>
            My research proposal is concerned with the research and development of the production of sustainable fabrics,
            made from PEF. PEF is chosen based on thourough research.
            However, Lil Green Wear wants to extend its R&D into alternative eco-friendly textiles.

            <h3>Alternatives</h3>
            <p>
                There are a myriad of eco-friendly textile alternatives out there. Future R&D may be considered if future assessment
                signals appropriate utilisation in our context. Despite the available options, many of these materials do not fit the
                requirements for apparel. They appear to compromise on quality (recycled fiber, peace silk), tap on food sources (PLA,
                soybean fibre), require high manpower (organic cotton), time-consuming (pineapple fibre), are specialised to specific plant
                types (hemp, lyocell) or carry potential health concerns (organic wool, rayon).

                        to cotton and has a high yield of 20-30% plant made of fibre.

                        cause Parkinson’s disease and other health problems. Big manufacturers may replace original trees with
                        bamboos for large scale productions, which may not be as friendly to the environment.

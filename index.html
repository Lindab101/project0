        <h4>Problem</h4>
        <p>


            The fashion industry is one of the major polluting industries. It is known to be responsible for about 10% of the greenhouse gas
            emission worldwide (more carbon emissions than the aviation and shipping industries combined), but it is also under fire for
            polluting the ocean with microplastics. About 60% of clothing materials are made of plastics, including polyester, acrylic and
            nylon textiles. To read more about the impacts of the fashion industry on the environment and how this is evolving in Singapore,

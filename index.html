                <h2> Our Mission</h2>
                <p>
                    Lil Green Wear was founded in 2020 by Linda Bijlard. Noticing the massive impact of environmental pollution caused by the
                    fashion industry, the founder spotted an opportunity in a potential market within Singapore to perform R&D of PEF, a 100%
                    bio-based material made from plant sugars that can directly replace PET, an important plastic, used in many aspects of our
                    daily life.
                    The company name, Lil Green Wear, comes from aspirations to amplify little environmental efforts from each of us to make a
                    great impact on the environment. We hope to develop textiles and clothing of matching, if not superior quality to the current
                    commercial source of textiles, to significantly reduce carbon foot-print in daily life. This way “green-ifying” more and more
                    of our daily-used items like school uniforms. Lil Green Wear could offer a fashionable yet impactful channel for everyone to
                    play a part in conserving our environment regardless of age or status. Thus, making you look as bright as your future.

                    The logo of Lil Green Wear symbolizes how the fate of the environment can be made better simply by what we choose to wear.
                    In our hands, we hold the key to plant-based apparel that is environmentally sustainable. We seek to promote this concept
                    in hopes that our customers and investors can join us in choosing to be responsible for the future.

                    We aim to develop and manufacture novel high quality bio-based and biodegradable polyester textiles to supply clothing
                    manufacturers and move towards an environmentally-friendly and sustainable future while satisfying the high demand for
                    apparel in Singapore.

                    In this modern day and age, materials used for the manufacture of apparel have mainly been synthetic polyesters that involve
                    many raw materials such as crude oil. This makes the fashion industry extremely detrimental to the environment.
                    Therefore, Lil Green Wear focuses on the research and development of biodegradable and durable polyesters involving a
                    novel technology which provides cost-competitive yet highly environmentally sustainable materials for apparel use.
                    This novel technology that can manufacture plastics from plant-based sugars can be more cost-effective and their
                    biodegradability allows us to close the loop of our textile life cycle.
